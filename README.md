# A-simple-calculator-using-Python
I built this simple calculator using Python programming.

I added some simple features to this calculator which makes it usable even in real-life scenarios:
- Backspace: The user can delete the last character
- Error: In case of an error, the result will simply show 'Error' and there will be no issues with running the program.
